# Setup & Loading Instacart Dataset

```{r loading packages + setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

The instacart dataset describes online grocery shopping behaviors from local stores across New York City from 2017. The dataset contains **`r nrow(instacart)`** observations and **`r ncol(instacart)`** variables in total, including name of the product, the aisle, and the department. The dataset also includes a mix of numeric and categorical variables. The average order hour of the day among shopping users is approximately **`r instacart |> pull(order_hour_of_day) |> mean(na.rm = TRUE) |> round()`**, whereas the average number of days since last order is **`r instacart |> pull(days_since_prior_order) |> mean(na.rm = TRUE) |> round()`**. Altogether, this means users mostly grocery shop early afternoon with users typicaly reodering every 17 days.
